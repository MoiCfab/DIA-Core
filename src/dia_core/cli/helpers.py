"""CLI helper functions for DIA-Core.

This module centralises common operations performed by the command-line
interface. These helpers encapsulate ancillary logic such as computing
dynamic risk overrides, sending notifications and writing monitoring
information. By moving these responsibilities out of the CLI entry
points the core functions remain concise and therefore easier to test
and maintain. None of the functions defined here are intended to
perform any business critical computation; they only orchestrate
existing pure logic from other modules and perform I/O when required.

The helpers catch a small set of anticipated exceptions rather than
blanket catching ``Exception``. This aligns with the coding guidelines
prohibiting broad exception handling while still protecting the CLI
from crashing on non-critical issues such as file permission errors.
